PFuseFS README
============
  Plain FUSE bindings.
  The C ext is derived from fusefs-osx but stripped back to allow more logic in Ruby - the language you'd rather do tricky things in.
  The FuseFS library also includes FuseFS::DirEntry, FuseFS::FileEntry and FuseFS::Entries helpers, the latter calling back to your getattr function to create an accurate stat struct.

Requirements
------------
  * FUSE (http://fuse.sourceforge.org)
  * Ruby 1.8
 (* C compiler)

Install
-------
	gem install dsturnbull-fusefs

Usage
-----
  require 'fusefs'

  Some sample ruby filesystems are listed in "sample/"

  When you run a fusefs script, it will listen on a socket indefinitely, so
  either background the script or open another terminal to mosey around in the
  filesystem.

  Also, check the API.txt file for more use.
